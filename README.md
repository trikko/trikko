👋 Hi, I'm __Andrea Fontana__ — developer, maker, and occasional pianist.

I've been programming for decades, and I still enjoy building tools that are fast, minimal, and open. Whether it's code, hardware, or music, I like crafting things that work simply and well.

## Open Source Projects

🛠 **Applications built in D**:

- ...and more

## Maker Projects

On the hardware side, I design and 3D print custom tools and gadgets — you can find many of them on [my Printables page](https://www.printables.com/@AndreaFontana).

## Support My Work

These projects are created in my spare time and shared freely with the community. If you use any of my tools in your workflow or projects, consider:

- ⭐ Starring the repositories you find useful
- 🐛 Contributing with bug reports or pull requests
- ☕ [Supporting my work through GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/trikko)

Your support helps me dedicate more time to maintaining and improving these open source tools.
